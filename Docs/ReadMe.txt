Description
===========

krpRegions library was designed specially for software developers who are bored of standard box-styled windows and want to create cool and unusual application interfaces.

krpRegions library is a set of powerful and easy-to-use components for Borland Delphi/C++Builder. This library uses two fundamental technologies: Skingines and AREA-BY-COLOR algorithm. Also we present our skin format and hope this format will be useful and popular.


Requirements
============
* Borland Delphi 3 (and  higher) or C++Builder 3 (and higher). 
* OS: Windows 95/98/Me/NT4/2000/XP.


How to install?
===============
Run the installation program and choose the destination folder. After installation components should appear.

If you don't see new components in the components palette:
1. Run Delphi or C++ Builder.
2. Select 'File/Open...' menu item
3. Open .dpk or .bpk depending of Delphi/C++Builder version (krpRegions_D4.dpk means Delphi 4, krpRegions_C3.bpk - C++ Builder 3).
4. Press 'Install' button in the Package Editor.
5. Please don't forget turn off 'Stop on Delphi Exception' checkbox in Debug options of Delphi/C++Builder IDE.
