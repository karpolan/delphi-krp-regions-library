# krpRegions library
The **krpRegions library** is a set of components for **Borland Delphi** and **C++Builder** to create cool, unusual, or **skinnable** program user interfaces. This components set is the easiest way to make **skinnable** or **non-rectangular** windows.

It was created by **Anton Karpenko** (better known as [**KARPOLAN**](https://karpolan.com)) in 1998.

This set of components was a **closed-source product**, it was commercially distributed by **ABF software, Inc.** between 2000 and 2020  years.

In 2024 the author got permission from **ABF** to publish all source code of **krpRegions library** as is.

Enjoy :)

## Description
The **krpRegions library** was designed especially for software developers who are bored of standard box-styled windows and want to create cool and unusual application interfaces.

The **krpRegions library** is a set of powerful and easy-to-use components for Borland Delphi/C++Builder. This library uses two fundamental technologies: **Skingine** and **AREA-BY-COLOR algorithm**. 


## Requirements
* Borland Delphi 3 (and  higher) or C++Builder 3 (and higher). 
* OS: Windows 95/98/Me/NT4/2000/XP/7-11


## How to install?
Run the installation program and choose the destination folder. After installation components should appear.

If you don't see new components in the components palette:
1. Run Delphi or C++ Builder.
2. Select *File/Open...* menu item
3. Open *.dpk* or *.bpk* depending of Delphi/C++Builder version (*krpRegions_D4.dpk* means **Delphi 4**, *krpRegions_C3.bpk* - **C++ Builder 3**).
4. Press *Install* button in the Package Editor.
5. Please don't forget to turn off *Stop on Delphi Exception* checkbox in the *Debug options* of Delphi/C++Builder IDE.
6. Make sure that the **destination folder** is present in the Delphi/C++Builder **library search path**.
